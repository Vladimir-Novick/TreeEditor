# TreeEditor
This tree editor allows users to create and manipulate hierarchical trees .

The tree is rendered using the tree viewer component while it is being edited - providing a degree of "WYSIWYG" editing.

Individual nodes can be created, manipulated, moved and deleted - and there are also a range of operations which act on multiple nodes at once.
